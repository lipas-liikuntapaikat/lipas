 "The diversity tool can be used to evaluate and compare the diversity of physical activity conditions in the residents' local environment at the grid and area level. The diversity index calculated by the diversity tool describes how diversely different physical activity opportunities the resident can reach within the selected distance along the road and path network (assuming 800 m). The higher the index value, the more diverse physical activity facilities are available in the residents' local environment.",
 :diversity-help2
 "The tool uses a postal code-based area division by default. The division can also be made based on another existing area division by importing the desired geometry file (Shapefile, GeoJSON or KML).",

 "The calculation is done per 250 x 250 m population grid from Statistics Finland. The area-level results indicate the average diversity of physical activity conditions in the residents' local environments (population-weighted average of the diversity index). The calculation distance of the diversity tool is based on the OpenStreetMap road network data and the OSRM tool.",
